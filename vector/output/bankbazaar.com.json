Banks and financial institutions offer the lowest personal loan interest rates to applicants who have a high credit score. Thus, you should check your credit score before applying for a personal loan. If your **credit score is less than 750** , you should look for ways to improve it. There are more chances of you getting a personal loan at a low interest if your **credit score is over 750**.\n  2.  **Avoid Missing Repayments** : If you miss a loan or credit card repayment, your credit score may be adversely affected. Loan providers usually take your repayment history into account before deciding the personal loan interest rates. Those who have paid their past EMIs and [credit card bills](/credit-card-bill-payment.html) on time are likely to be charged a lower interest.\n  3.  **Keep an Eye Out for Offers** : Banks and financial institutions usually offer special interest rates for a limited period of time during festive occasions. If you apply for a loan while such an offer is running, you may be offered a lower rate of interest.\n  4.  **Compare Interest Rates** : Before applying to a particular bank for a personal loan, it is necessary to compare the personal loan interest rates charged by various [NBFCs](/personal-loan/nbfcs.html) and banks. This will help you avail a personal loan at a competitive interest rate.\n  5.  **Negotiate with the Lender** : If you are an existing customer of a bank or have a good relationship with the loan provider, you can negotiate for the lowest interest rate. When doing this, it is advisable to submit a formal written request to the loan provider.\n\nAmong the various points that are mentioned above, the credit score of an\napplicant is one of the primary factors that is taken into account by banks\nand financial institutions to decide the interest rate. Make sure to [check\nyour credit score](/credit-score.html) at the earliest to ensure that you are\noffered a favorable interest rate.\n\nCIBIL Ratings\n\n|\n\nCredit Score\n\n|\n\nChances of being approved for a Personal Loan  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \nPoor\n\n|\n\nLess than 600\n\n|\n\nYou may not qualify for a personal loan  \n  \nAverage\n\n|\n\nBetween 600 and 750\n\n|\n\nLoan may be approved, but at a high interest rate  \n  \nGood\n\n|\n\nOver 750\n\n|\n\nLoan is likely to be approved with a lower interest rate  \n  \nExcellent\n\n|\n\nBetween 800 and 900\n\n|\n\nLoan with a low interest rate, faster approval, larger loan amount  \n  \n[![Check Free Credit Score Now](https://static.bankbazaar.com/images/credit-\ncore-asvg.svg)](https://www.bankbazaar.com/credit-\nscore.html?variant=slide&WT.mc_id=CROSS_SELL_IL_PLBUTTON_svg_84783&utm_source=bb&utm_medium=seo&utm_campaign=CROSS_SELL_IL_PLBUTTON_svg_84783)\n\n## Factors that Affect Personal Loan Interest Rates\n\n  1.  **Income:** Loan providers take the applicant's income into account when deciding the interest rate. Individuals who have a high income pose a lower risk to the bank and, thus, might be offered a lower interest rate. On the other hand, those with lower annual incomes may have to pay a higher interest rate.\n  2.  **Employer Details:** If you work for a reputed organisation, the bank/financial institution is more likely to offer you a lower rate of interest.\n  3.  **Nature of Employment:** Loan providers may offer different interest rates to applicants based on whether they are self-employed or [salaried](/personal-loan-for-salaried-persons.html).\n  4.  **Age:** The age of the applicant can also have an impact on the interest rate quoted by the loan provider. Individuals who are nearing retirement age may be charged a higher interest rate.\n  5.  **Relationship with the Loan Provider:** Existing customers of the bank/financial institution may be offered a lower rate of interest at the time of applying for a personal loan, provided they have a good relationship with the loan provider. This is, however, at the discretion of the bank and not all existing customers will be offered a preferential interest rate.\n\n[FREE Credit Score - Check Now ](https://www.bankbazaar.com/credit-\nscore.html?variant=slide&WT.mc_id=CROSS_SELL_IL_PLBUTTON_84783&utm_source=bb&utm_medium=seo&utm_campaign=CROSS_SELL_IL_PLBUTTON_84783\n\"FREE Credit Score - Check Now\")\n\n## Fixed Interest Rates vs Floating Interest Rates - Which is better?\n\nFixed interest rate\n\n|\n\nFloating interest rate  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nInterest rates remain constant\n\n|\n\nInterest rate can change depending on the fluctuation in the market  \n  \nYour EMI payable will remain the same throughout the repayment tenure\n\n|\n\nYour EMI payable is likely to change during the repayment tenure.  \n  \nYou are likely to be charged a prepayment charge if you prepay your loan\n\n|\n\nYou may not be charged a prepayment charge if you prepay your loan  \n  \nNot linked to MCLR\n\n|\n\nLinked to MCLR  \n  \nThe benefit of opting for a fixed interest rate is that you know exactly how\nmuch you will be charged during the loan tenure. Thus, those who wish to plan\ntheir finances in advance can opt for a fixed interest rate.\n\nIf you, however, don't mind a fluctuating interest rate, you can opt for a\nfloating/variable interest rate. The benefit of opting for a variable interest\nrate is that your repayment amount will reduce when the interest rate is low.\n\n[![Credit\nscore](https://static.bankbazaar.com/images/interstitials/contextual-inline-\nbanner-dsk.svg)](https://www.bankbazaar.com/credit-\nscore.html?variant=slide&WT.mc_id=CROSS_SELL_IL_PL_DSK&utm_source=bb&utm_medium=seo&utm_campaign=CROSS_SELL_IL_PL_DSK)\n\n## What is meant by Reducing Interest Rate with regard to Personal Loan?\n\nWhen you avail a [personal loan at a flat interest rate](/personal-\nloan/personal-loan-flat-and-reducing-interest-rate.html), the interest is\ncalculated on the entire loan amount throughout the loan repayment period. In\ncomparison, if you avail a loan at a reducing interest rate/reducing balance\nrate structure, the interest is only calculated on the outstanding loan\namount. Thus, in this case, when you make a monthly repayment, the interest\nfor the remainder of the loan tenure will be calculated on the outstanding\nloan balance.\n\n#### Things to Consider\n\nWhile selecting a personal loan with a low interest rate, there are a few\nother things that you should consider:\n\n  1.  **Processing Fee:** Loan providers levy a one-time charge known as the processing fee, which can increase the cost of the loan. Even if you are charged a low interest, it is important to check and compare the processing fee charged by different lenders.\n  2.  **Pre-Closure Charges:** Certain banks may charge you a pre-closure fee if you repay the outstanding loan balance before the completion of the loan repayment tenure. Make sure to check if the bank/financial institution that you are applying to levies a pre-closure charge.\n  3.  **Customer Service:** In order to have good borrowing experience, it is necessary to apply to a lender that offers good customer service. Before submitting your loan application, you should check the customer care channels that are available and how prompt the lender is in providing you assistance when required.\n  4.  **Eligibility Criteria:** While the bank or financial institution may offer personal loans at low interest rates, you should make it a point to check if you meet the eligibility criteria specified by the lender. To this end, you should ensure that you check if your income meets the set limit and if you meet the age requirements specified.\n  5.  **Loan Disbursal Time:** If you are looking to take a personal loan due to an emergency, it is important to take the loan disbursal time into account. A number of leading banks and financial institutions disburse the loan amount within a matter of seconds.\n  6.  **Other Charges:** While the lender may charge you a slightly higher interest rate, you may be able to save on the overall cost of the loan if the processing fee, default charges, pre-payment fee, Loan Cancellation Charges, Check/EMI bounce charges, Instrument return charges, Stamp Duty Charges, Duplicate statement issuance charges, swap charges, Duplicate Amortization schedule issuance charges, etc., are low. Thus, make sure you compare the various charges levied by the lender before applying for a personal loan.\n  7.  **Discounts:** Although the bank/financial institution may have specified a high interest rate, you can try to negotiate with the bank for the lowest interest rate. Many times, lenders will give a discount to existing customers and to those who have maintained a healthy relationship with them. \n  8. **Special Offers:** Certain lenders may charge you a lower interest rate during festive occasions.\n\n*Some loan providers do charge a comparatively higher interest rate; however, you should take certain other factors into account before making a decision.\n\nThinking of consolidating your debts?

However,\nthe interest rate may vary from customer to customer depending on certain\nfactors, customer's including credit profile and relationship with the bank,\nto name a few.\n\n  *  **How does my income determine my interest rate?**\n\nYour income denotes your capacity to repay a loan. A higher income shows that\nyou have a better financial bandwidth to repay the loan on time. This means\nthat your risk level is low. Lenders prefer individuals with low-risk profiles\nand may hence offer you a lower interest rate.\n\n  *  **How do my employment history and experience play a role in determining the rate of interest?**\n\nWorking with reputable companies means that you are more likely to have a\nstable job and income. Your work experience shows work stability as well. This\nreflects your loan rate.\n\n  *  **How does my credit score impact the cost of my loan?**\n\nA good credit score indicates that you are responsible in handling your\nfinances. This keeps your risk rating low. If your credit score is 750 and\nabove, most likely you will be offered preferential rates.\n\n  *  **How does my current debt level determine my interest rate?**\n\nWhen processing your loan application, lenders will look at how much debt you\ncurrently have. If you're spending most of your current income to repay\nexisting loans, they may not grant you a personal loan. Even if they do, they\nwill charge you a high rate of interest.\n\n  *  **How can I get a good interest rate?**\n\nIf you have a credit score, preferably above 750 and are on good terms with\nthe lender concerned, you might get preferential rates. Also, working in a\nwell-known company and having a good credit profile may fetch you better\nrates.\n\n  *  **Can I get an interest rate lower than what is advertised by the lender?**\n\nYes, you may be able to get an interest rate lower than what is advertised by\nthe lender. This is where negotiation plays a vital role. If you're able to\nnegotiate well with the lender, you may be able to get a good rate.\n\n  *  **Can I get a low rate of interest even if my credit score is bad?**\n\nYes, you may be able to get a personal loan for low cibil score. You can try\nand get a good rate by getting a co-applicant with good credit to apply along\nwith you. Another way is to get a guarantor with good credit to back you up.\n\n  *  **If I offer collateral, will it help me get a good interest rate?**\n\nOffering collateral is another way to get an affordable rate of interest. Your\nrate is determined based on your risk level. Offering collateral reduces your\nrisk level significantly as it serves as security against non-repayment. But\ndo keep in mind that if you fail to repay the loan on time, the lender might\ntake over your collateral.\n\n  *  **Will I get a lower rate of interest if I take a loan from my existing lender?**\n\nHaving an existing relationship with a bank or lender is always beneficial. If\nyou have a good relationship with your current banker, you're likely to get\nbetter loan terms. For example, you may get a rate of interest better than\nwhat most others get.\n\n  *  **Should I always choose the lowest available interest rate?**\n\nThe interest on the loan denotes the cost of your borrowing. Hence, it is\nalways better to opt for the lowest interest rate available in the market when\nyou're applying for the loan. But keep an eye out for other charges levied by\nyour lender.\n\n  *  **How is the processing fee calculated?**\n\nDifferent lenders charge varying processing fees. This is calculated either as\na percentage of the loan amount you apply for or as a fixed fee set by the\nlender.\n\n  *  **Can I avoid paying prepayment fees?**\n\nThe only way you can avoid paying this fee is if your lender waives it off or\ndoesn't charge you for making prepayments.\n\n  *  **Should I prepay my loan even if I'm charged a prepayment fee?**\n\nThis depends on whether you can make up for paying the fee. Prepaying your\nloan will help you save on interest costs. Prepayments reduce your outstanding\nprincipal, which in turn, reduces the interest cost. Compare and see if the\nprepayment charges are lower than the interest amount you save. If yes, then\nit makes sense to prepay and terminate your loan faster.\n\n  *  **How much will I have to pay if I miss paying an EMI?**\n\nYour lender will charge you a late payment fee if you fail to pay your EMI on\ntime. This fee will be mentioned in your loan document. Apart from this, you\nmay also have to pay a penalty for late payment.\n\n  *  **Can banks change the interest rate during the loan tenure?**\n\nIf you opt for a personal loan with a fixed interest rate, there will be no\nchanges to the interest rate during the loan tenure. If you opt for a floating\ninterest, the bank may change the interest rate when the MCLR changes.\n\n  *  **Are personal loan interest rates fixed or floating?**\n\nYou can opt for a fixed interest rate or floating interest rate, based on the\noptions that are provided by the lender.\n\n  *  **Should I take a loan from a loan provider that offers the lowest EMI?**\n\nWhile the EMI is an important factor to take into account, you should also\nconsider other factors such as the processing fee, tenure of the loan,\ninterest rate charged, repayment options, reliability of the loan provider,\netc., when applying for a personal loan.\n\n  *  **How often does the variable or floating interest rate change?**\n\nBanks will change the variable/floating interest rate each time the Repo-\nlinked Lending Rate (RLLR) changes, as and when decided by RBI.\n\n  *  **What is the average interest rate on personal loans?**\n\nMost banks charge personal loan interest rates between **10.50% to 24% p.a.**\nThe interest rate that you are charged will vary based on a number of factors\nsuch as your credit score, your income, the company that you are employed\nwith, your age at the time of applying for the loan, etc. Thus, make sure to\ncompare interest rates of different loan providers before applying for a\npersonal loan.\n\n  *  **How do I benefit if the interest is calculated on a daily/monthly reducing balance?**\n\nIn the case of monthly reducing loans, the principal amount gets reduced each\ntime you pay an EMI, and the interest will only be calculated on the\noutstanding balance. In the case of daily reducing loans, the principal gets\nreduced on a daily basis and the interest is charged on whatever balance is\noutstanding. You, being the borrower, stand to benefit if you opt for a\nmonthly/daily reducing personal loan since the overall interest that you will\nhave to pay will be less.\n\n  *  **Is there any relationship discount on interest rates?**\n\nIf you currently have a good relationship with a loan provider, i.e. you are\nan existing customer of the bank/NBFC or you have availed a loan in the past\nfor which all repayments were done as per schedule, you may be offered a\npreferential interest rate. However, this does not mean that all existing\ncustomers who apply for a personal loan will be offered a discounted interest\nrate.\n\n  *  **How does balance transfer help you get a lower interest rate?**\n\nPersonal loan balance transfer is a process by which the borrower transfers\ntheir outstanding loan balance from their current loan provider to a new loan\nprovider. The primary benefit of doing this is that you can transfer the\noutstanding loan amount to a bank/financial institution that offers a lower\ninterest rate, thereby reducing the overall interest that you will have to pay\nduring the loan tenure.\n\n **Important Personal Loan Pages**\n\n  1.
